🔒 Security Note
Password Security: Passwords are fully hashed using SHA-256 inside the database system to ensure they are never stored in plain text.

Data Management: All core system data lives strictly inside the single laundry_system.db file.

Production Recommendations: If adapting this software for real-world application deployments, prioritize scheduling regular database backups, establishing robust password validation criteria, and ensuring appropriate host system network firewalls
